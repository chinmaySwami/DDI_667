Drug Drug interaction information extraction is important yet a complex task.  Interaction between two administered drugs could lead to minor side effects or a major health threatening condition.  Such types of adverse effects is found to be 8th leading cause of death is us as per apaper published in Internet Scientific Journals Goldstein et al. (2005).  We plan on leveraging computational linguistics techniques paired with deep learning techniques to identify whether 2  drugs  when  administered  to  the  same  patient  in  the  same  time  frame  would  cause  any unexpected  reactions.Currently  we  are  looking  at  various  deep  learning  techniques  such  as LSTM’s, RNN’s etc.
